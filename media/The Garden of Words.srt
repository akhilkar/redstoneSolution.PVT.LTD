1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,960
Until I entered high school two months ago, I didn't know...

2
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,200
The dampness of my uniform's hem, soaked by someone else's umbrella...

3
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,700
The warm body pressed up against my back...

4
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,530
The cool breeze of the air conditioner against my face...

5
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,530
Shinjuku... Shinjuku station...

6
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,790
Thank you for riding with us.

7
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,930
When I was little, the sky was closer... Much, much closer.

8
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,500
That's why I like the rain, since with it comes the smell of the sky.

9
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,310
And often, on rainy mornings, instead of transferring to the subway, I exit out the station gates.

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,520
June

11
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,600
Chocolate and... beer?

12
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,370
But, I think I've seen her somewhere...

13
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,360
-Here. -Thank you.

14
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,980
Um... have we met before?

15
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,480
No.

16
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,670
I'm sorry, my mistake.

17
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,470
It's okay.

18
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,190
Maybe it's fitting...

19
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,480
A faint clap of thunder

20
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,840
Clouded skies

21
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,910
Perhaps rain comes

22
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,970
If so, will you stay here with me?

23
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,760
The Garden of Words

24
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:57,270
The Garden of Words

25
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,730
This morning, the JMA has declared the start of the rainy season in Kyushu, five days earlier than average.

26
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,750
Nagasaki, Saga, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima prefectures expect strong rains over a wide area.

27
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,310
I'm home.

28
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,540
Welcome home.

29
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,970
I bought croquettes.

30
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,100
Great. Dinner will be ready soon.

31
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,640
Thanks.

32
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,150
Where's Ma?

33
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,460
Ran out.

34
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,300
Lucky us, we get all the croquettes to ourselves.

35
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,660
She left a letter saying not to go looking for her.

36
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,140
But maybe...

37
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,210
Leave her be.

38
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,470
I'm sure she'll be back after fighting with her boyfriend.

39
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,070
I've picked out a place. I'll be leaving next month.

40
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,570
Living alone?

41
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,800
With my girlfriend.

42
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,360
Don't think that's why Mom ran out?

43
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,630
You told her yesterday, right?

44
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,540
I wish she could just let her children go, you know?

45
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,260
She's the one who's making the rounds dating younger men.

46
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,240
Oh, yeah? Well then I'm gonna go live with my boyfriend!

47
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,100
She's got those youthful looks, after all.

48
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,610
That's 'cause she's never worked hard her a day in her life.

49
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,440
You're the one who's been piling on the years.

50
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,950
All done.

51
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,950
You do the dishes. I've aged enough.

52
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,140
Won't you be glad to have more space?

53
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,010
Suppose so.

54
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,300
Help me move, 'kay?

55
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,010
Sure.

56
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,440
Hey, have you heard of this?

57
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,690
What's this, a haiku?

58
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,810
It's a tanka.

59
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,570
As if.

60
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,810
Ask Ma when she gets back.

61
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,420
On sunny mornings, I transfer to the subway and head here, like I'm supposed to.

62
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,380
But I think to myself This isn't what I should be doing right now. 

63
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,020
Rain...

64
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,450
Hi.

65
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,650
Hello.

66
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,950
Hey...

67
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,950
No school today?

68
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,180
And your office... Closed today?

69
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,910
I'm skipping work again.

70
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,250
And drinking beer in the park in the morning.

71
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,570
Drinking beer alone isn't good for your health.

72
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,030
You need to eat something with it.

73
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,710
You know a lot for a high schooler.

74
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,280
It's not me. My mom's the drinker.

75
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,410
I've got snack food.

76
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,520
Want some?

77
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,940
You just thought to yourself This woman's a freak, didn't you?

78
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,810
No, I...

79
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,590
It's okay. We're human, after all.

80
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,930
We've all got our little quirks.

81
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,800
Maybe...

82
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,650
Definitely.

83
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,930
Okay, it's about time for me to go.

84
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,420
Heading to school now?

85
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,510
I've decided to only skip school on rainy mornings.

86
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,770
Well, we might see each other again.

87
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,490
Maybe when it's raining.

88
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,790
It was the first day of Kanto's rainy season.

89
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,710
A shoemaker?

90
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,050
I know it seems out of touch,

91
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,320
but I enjoy creating designs and making shoes.

92
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,960
Of course, I'm still terrible at it.

93
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,360
Of course...

94
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,140
But despite it all, I want to make it my career... if I can.

95
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,860
I've never told anyone this before.

96
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,780
Do you have any idea how late you are?

97
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,290
You know why I've called you here, right?

98
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,170
Hey...

99
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,850
Evenings, before I went to sleep...

100
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,020
Mornings, in the moment I woke up...

101
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,860
I realized I was praying for rain.

102
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,490
I realized that on sunny days, I was in a terrible, childish place,

103
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,090
with nothing but impatience.

104
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:19,260
She exists in a world of working adults, so very far away from me.

105
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,260
To me, she represents nothing less than the very secrets of the world.

106
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,910
Honestly, there are only two things I know for sure.

107
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,810
One: she must think a 15-year-old like me is just a little kid.

108
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:44,260
And two: making shoes is the only thing that will lead me away from here.

109
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,530
Please stay behind the yellow line for your safety.

110
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,100
Please be careful of the closing doors.

111
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,590
Good morning.

112
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,700
I thought you might not come today.

113
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,170
It's a miracle you haven't been fired yet.

114
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,400
Wow! Is that a shoe design?

115
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,270
Hey!

116
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,530
I can't see?

117
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,290
It's not something worth showing.

118
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,070
Really?

119
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,300
Yes, really!

120
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,200
Come on, sit down over there.

121
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,620
I'm going to eat breakfast. Would you like to join me?

122
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,720
Thanks, but I brought my own.

123
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,340
You made it yourself?

124
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,460
What? I cook sometimes, for your information.

125
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,750
Oh?

126
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,050
Then let's make a trade.

127
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,930
Wait, I'm not really that good a...

128
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,400
cook, you know.

129
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,690
It's your own fault.

130
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,880
That's a side of you I didn't expect.

131
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,170
What?

132
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,500
Sorry. But it's tasty in its own way.

133
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,570
It's got bite.

134
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,950
Don't patronize me.

135
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,860
Can I have another?

136
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,440
Hurry up!

137
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,050
Wait, bro!

138
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,140
Takao, be careful.

139
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,390
Happy birthday, Mom!

140
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,330
Thank you.

141
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,020
What could the three of you have gotten me?

142
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,030
Hey...

143
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,790
Do you think it's too late for me?

144
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,540
And you know what? I could actually taste the food.

145
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,660
So your taste disorder has improved?

146
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,040
I wouldn't go that far.

147
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,940
But just a little while ago, all I could taste was alcohol and chocolate.

148
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,720
I think you deciding to just quit was really for the best.

149
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,650
Maybe so.

150
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,880
You speak to me so gently,

151
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,940
like you're touching something fragile.

152
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,030
But back then, when I found it hard to even breathe,

153
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,130
you only listened to the voices around you.

154
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,200
You didn't believe me.

155
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,590
Then we'll start the paperwork for you leaving after the holiday.

156
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,450
I'll notify the higher-ups.

157
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,650
Okay. Sorry to cause you all this trouble even after we split up.

158
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,410
I'm glad, really...

159
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,060
About that old woman you met.

160
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,250
You know, the one you keep talking about who brings her lunch box to the park.

161
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,460
It seems like you've really struck a chord.

162
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,370
Yeah, get some rest.

163
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,150
Mr. Itou Mr. Itou

164
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,190
Ever since then,

165
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,360
I've been

166
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,080
nothing but lies.

167
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,380
Rain...

168
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,880
It's raining again today in Kanto.

169
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,890
Here at Shinjuku Station's south exit, the commuters all have umbrellas in their hands.

170
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:22,030
July

171
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,370
Here, this is for you.

172
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,820
For me?

173
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,300
I've always ended up eating your food, see...

174
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,170
And you said you wanted it, right?

175
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,960
This book isn't cheap.

176
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Thank you... very much.

177
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,720
It's my pleasure.

178
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,390
Um...

179
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,520
I'm actually making a pair of shoes right now.

180
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,180
Wow... A pair for yourself?

181
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,070
I haven't decided who they're for yet...

182
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,210
They're women's shoes.

183
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,460
But I haven't been able to get them right, and...

184
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,060
You know...

185
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,370
before I knew it, I wasn't able to walk properly anymore.

186
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,820
Are you talking about your job?

187
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,630
Yeah...

188
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,560
About a lot of things.

189
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,910
I don't know anything about her.

190
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,790
Her job, her age... what worries she carries...

191
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,950
Not even her name.

192
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:49,200
And yet I can't help but be charmed by her.

193
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,090
The rainy season is officially over ten days later than normal in the Kanto region.

194
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,810
The current temperature in the city is 26 degrees.

195
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:21,510
Like someone just flicked a switch, the sunny days came one after another.

196
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:28,970
Oh sure, now I think to myself I'm glad that he's not skipping class anymore.

197
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,970
But in reality...

198
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,560
I wish the rainy season

199
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,290
had never ended.

200
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,520
This park sure is big.

201
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,990
I can't believe we're in Shinjuku.

202
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,260
Oh, pardon us.

203
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,130
Go ahead.

204
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,050
This is the Japanese gardens, right?

205
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,340
Where should we go next?

206
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,150
Isn't there a greenhouse? Let's check it out.

207
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,280
Yeah, let's.

208
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,600
It's like a totally different place on sunny days.

209
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,340
Thanks for the help.

210
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,780
Hey, why don't you eat dinner with us, Takao?

211
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,820
Sorry, but I've got my part-time job today.

212
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,130
This late?

213
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,210
And I don't want to impose.

214
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,500
The opposite! I'm going to be living with him from now on, so just this once...

215
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,190
I can hear you.

216
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,180
Well then, see you later.

217
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,430
He's a cute kid.

218
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,490
Did you notice his shoes?

219
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,750
They're handmade.

220
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,790
What? Seriously?

221
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,380
Just some ugly moccasins, though.

222
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,580
He's got a bright future, doesn't he?

223
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,670
I wonder if he'd make shoes for me?

224
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,319
Who knows? Teenagers' interests change on a whim...

225
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,490
My brother moved out, and the rainless days continued.

226
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,730
I had no excuse to head to that place.

227
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,770
And then, it was summer vacation.
August

228
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,380
I worked part-time almost every day over the summer.

229
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,920
Hmm, maybe chicken with cashew nuts?

230
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,170
Looks good to me.

231
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,220
We'll order it.

232
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,890
I wanted to earn what I could for tuition to a vocational school.

233
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,980
Tools and leather cost money too.

234
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,900
Sure, I missed her, but...

235
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,660
I think it's clinging to those feelings that's keeping me a little kid.

236
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:03,610
That's why I've decided to make shoes that will make her want to get up and walk.

237
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,790
What will the weather be like tomorrow?

238
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:21,020
I'm twenty-seven, but I don't feel any smarter than I did twelve years ago.

239
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,740
I've always been here, stuck in the same place.

240
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:12,960
September

241
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,280
It's just like Tsukishima to have got that confused for a week!

242
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,500
English class is no big deal.

243
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,290
That's cause Kiso's a pushover.

244
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,130
Akizuki!

245
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,420
Hey, long time no see.

246
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,490
Looks like you guys got a tan.

247
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,230
Yeah, we went to the beach a bunch.

248
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,390
You're still as pale as ever.

249
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,620
What'd you do over summer break?

250
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,650
Worked the whole time.

251
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,800
The whole time?

252
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,900
That's a lonely way to spend your high school days.

253
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,520
School, job, chores. School, job, chores.

254
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,910
I skip school sometimes!

255
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,980
Now that you mention it, you are late a lot, Akizuki.

256
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,580
Yep, this guy never shows up for 1st period when it rains.

257
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,400
I've got a condition where I can't ride the subway on rainy mornings.

258
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,410
Whatever, weirdo.

259
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,990
Teacher's Office

260
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,370
Ms. Yukino?

261
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Ms. Yukino!

262
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,610
Satou...

263
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,460
Ms. Yukino...

264
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,210
Satou, save it for later.
Ms. Yukino!

265
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,220
Same goes for the rest of you.

266
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,050
I'm sorry, everyone.

267
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,790
I'll be here until after 5th period. After that, I'd be happy to.

268
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,730
Yukino came to school?

269
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,900
You didn't hear about her quittin'?

270
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,240
No. I didn't even know who she is.

271
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,100
You have old man Takehara for lit, right?

272
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,750
Yukino was always having trouble with the third-year girls.

273
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,260
Yeah, but Ms. Yukino didn't do anything wrong.

274
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,410
Someone's boyfriend fell for Ms. Yukino,

275
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,830
and as payback everyone in the class treated her terribly.

276
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,090
They spread so many rumors even her parents heard about them.

277
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,320
It went so far she couldn't come to school anymore.

278
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,940
Yukino's just too kind.

279
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,900
She should've brought it straight to the police.

280
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,210
We told Mr. Itou over and over!

281
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,470
But he didn't want to make a mess for the school in public.

282
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,410
Hey, what's the matter?

283
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,560
Those upperclassmen...

284
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,010
Do you know their names?

285
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,020
Ms. Yukino!

286
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,340
He totally sucks at it.

287
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,680
You're so cruel.

288
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,620
But man, you sure go through 'em.

289
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,660
What do you want, frosh?

290
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,940
Are you the third year, Aizawa?

291
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,150
An admirer?

292
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,650
Who the hell are you?

293
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,760
It seems like Ms. Yukino is quitting.

294
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,550
Huh?

295
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,970
Like I care about what happens to that slutty hag.

296
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,610
Who does this guy think he is?

297
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,560
Huh? What's this?

298
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,130
What's your deal?

299
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,250
Let's go tell a teacher...

300
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,070
Never seen this kid before.

301
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,120
Who are you?

302
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,100
Fallen for that old hag?

303
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,250
What a creep! Does he even know how old she is?

304
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,890
Poor guy. She must've tricked him.

305
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,530
She might go for him now, though.

306
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,820
Since she ain't a teacher no more.

307
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,800
Damn straight.

308
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,050
You should thank us.

309
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,870
I'm waiting for the rain.

310
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,280
A faint clap of thunder

311
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Even if rain comes not

312
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,450
I will stay here

313
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,780
Together with you

314
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,530
Yes, that's the correct answer.

315
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,720
That's the right response to the tanka I told you when we first met.

316
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,790
If it rains, I wonder if you will be staying here?

317
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,620
In response to that verse, I answer...

318
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,020
Even if it doesn't rain, I will be here.

319
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,080
It was in the classic Japanese literature textbook.

320
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,970
Ms. Yukino...

321
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,430
I'm sorry...

322
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,730
I thought you would realize I was a classic literature teacher.

323
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,270
I mean, everyone at school knows about me.

324
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,180
But you're always off in your own little world, aren't you?

325
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,680
Hey, what happened to your face?

326
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,880
I was acting like you and drank too much beer.

327
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,580
Then I tripped and fell on the Yamanote line platform.

328
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,190
Oh, my!

329
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,530
Just kidding.

330
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,930
I got in a fight, that's all.

331
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,470
Look... It looks like we just swam across the river.

332
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,600
I think this might...

333
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,130
this might be...

334
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,110
...the happiest...

335
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,730
time of my life.

336
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,160
Yukino...

337
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,760
Yes?

338
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,460
I think I've fallen in love with you.

339
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,070
Not Yukino.

340
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,430
Ms. Yukino, remember?

341
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,780
I'm going to be moving next week.

342
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,490
Back to my hometown in Shikoku.

343
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,290
I made the decision a while back.

344
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:24,080
I was practicing how to walk on my own, there in that place.

345
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,440
Even if I'm barefoot...

346
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,270
So then...

347
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,960
So I want to thank you for everything, Akizuki.

348
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,400
Um, thank you for lending me these clothes.

349
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,330
I'll get changed now.

350
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,220
But yours aren't ...

351
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,660
Excuse me...

352
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,530
I'm going home.

353
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,420
Thank you for your hospitality.

354
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,970
I made this lunch for myself, but I made too much.

355
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,220
So if you'd like...

356
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,050
I haven't decided who they're for yet...

357
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,470
They're women's shoes.

358
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,480
I was acting like you and drank too much beer.

359
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,170
Then I tripped and fell on the Yamanote line platform.

360
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,260
A faint clap of thunder

361
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,250
Even if rain comes not

362
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,000
I will stay here

363
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,330
Together with you

364
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,140
Um...

365
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,170
Yukino,

366
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,920
please forget what I said earlier.

367
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,740
I was wrong... I hate you after all.

368
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,760
Ever since we first met, you struck me...

369
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,920
like a person I should avoid.

370
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:47,550
Drinking beer in the morning, spouting off some random tanka at me...

371
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,650
All day long you listen to other people talking,

372
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,680
yet never say a peep about yourself...

373
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,220
You knew I was a student, didn't you?

374
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,090
That's completely unfair!

375
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:03,700
If I'd known you were a teacher, I would've never told you about the shoes.

376
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,530
After all, you think I'll never amount to anything!

377
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,140
So why didn't you say anything to me?

378
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,330
You thought maybe you'd humor the little kid's fantasies for a while?

379
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,760
Tell me I'll never live up to my expectations!

380
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,210
Tell me I'll never measure up to my dreams!

381
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,810
You knew from the very beginning!

382
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,420
So tell me, god damn it!

383
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,740
Tell me I'm in your way!

384
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,200
Tell me that little kids should run along to school!

385
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,010
Tell me that you hate me!

386
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:32,800
You...

387
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,350
You're always like that.

388
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,680
You never say what's important,

389
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,770
pretending that it's not your problem and live on like that

390
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,950
all alone!

391
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,450
Every morning!

392
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,600
Every morning I put on my suit to go to school...

393
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,250
But I was scared...

394
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,340
I just couldn't go...

395
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,810
In that place...

396
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,260
You...

397
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,540
You...

398
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,350
saved me!

399
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,210
I lived on with feelings frozen

400
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,220
Never expressed in words

401
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:40,320
And I clumsily held you in my arms on a rainy night

402
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,790
Street flyers and broken lamps

403
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:51,500
Everybody was rushing back and forth

404
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,260
It's not you but me who is to blame

405
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:01,090
I couldn't hide my own impulsiveness

406
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:12,010
Lady, you started running through a deserted station

407
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,300
Unconcerned about getting soaked from the pouring rain

408
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,580
The sight of you splashing through puddles disappears

409
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,170
Morning comes quicker in the back alleys

410
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,810
So I have to get hold of you now

411
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:34,490
To say, Don't go away, don't go away

412
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,720
Summer ended, and it came time to switch to our winter uniforms.

413
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,850
I got terrible grades on my finals.

414
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,810
I wasted who knows how many pieces of expensive leather.

415
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,640
I worked part-time over winter break as well.

416
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,040
And every time I added a layer to my clothing,

417
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,340
I wondered to myself how she was doing.

418
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:00,210
I don't have enough strength anymore

419
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,620
To grab onto the sky that's welled up with tears

420
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:14,160
You're strong enough not to feel hurt because of my unchanging heart

421
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:25,410
Lady, all wet from the rain, you looked into my eyes for a moment

422
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,580
Unconcerned about getting soaked from the pouring rain

423
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,730
Whistling, I walk after you

424
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,380
Even though I came to know a side of you I wasn't interested in

425
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,980
Just like the night we first fought

426
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:48,090
I say, Don't go away, don't go away

427
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,280
When I head out the gates and my shirt's shoulders are dry

428
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,780
It no longer rains much in your town

429
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,460
Only today continues into tomorrow

430
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,270
That's how you and I can never end

431
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,520
Lady, even now you still

432
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,500
Don't even open up a little umbrella

433
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:47,180
Unconcerned about getting soaked from the pouring rain

434
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:52,540
The sight of you splashing through puddles disappears

435
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:57,710
Morning comes quicker in the back alleys, so I have to get hold of you now

436
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:02,950
To say, Don't go away, don't go away

437
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:08,150
Unconcerned about getting soaked from the pouring rain

438
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:13,340
Whistling, I walk after you

439
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,980
Even though I came to know a side of you I wasn't interested in

440
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,600
Just like the night we first fought

441
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:25,180
I say, Don't go away, don't go away

442
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:18,000
This letter has gotten quite long without me even realizing it. Thanks so much for reading it all. I hope you're doing well, Akizuki. I hope the warm days of spring come soon. Yukari Yukino

443
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,050
I was practicing how to walk too.

444
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,310
That's what I think now.

445
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,540
One day, when I can walk much farther on my own...

446
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,160
I'll go see her.
